# Decrypting-Caesar-Cipher-using-Brute-Force

By iterating through the index of each letter
of the English alphabet and shuffling each 
caesar cipher encrypted character with a key 
equal to the index of the letter, I then concatenated 
the characters to form a word. The word is 
checked in a data set containing more than 
400,000 english words. If the word is found 
in the data set, then we have a valid word thus 
the encryption key equals the index of the 
character at the instance the word was formed. 
We then shift each character in the text backwards 
with respect to the key. Text is decoded at once!!!!
